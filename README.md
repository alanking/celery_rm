# celery_rm

This project is an experimental Celery application. It is meant for educating myself about Celery and to eventually demonstrate a fully parallel, recursive removal tool for iRODS collections and data objects. It is like the reverse of the iRODS Automated Ingest Capability: https://github.com/irods/irods_capability_automated_ingest
